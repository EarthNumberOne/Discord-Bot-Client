# Discord-Bot-Client

This is the client (not actually) for discord bot.

IMPORTANT!!!

This code is written in python 3.7, I'm not sure if it can run lower than this version

# How to use it

You need to enter the message you want to send and the id of the channel.

# Install and Run

You will need to register a certificate for the python version of you installed.

After you did that, you need to enter "pip3 install discord" in terminal or cmd.

And finally run this code!
